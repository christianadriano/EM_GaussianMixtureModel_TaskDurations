# EM_GaussianMixtureModel_TaskDurations
 Expectation Maximization to build Gaussian mixture models of the duration of task executions.
 I discovered some cool Simpsom Paradox phenomenon for certain professions. For less skilled groups, taking longer to finish a task is related to being clueless, whereas to other professional groups is being thorough. Cluelessness and thoroughness were determined by the effect of task duration on the accuracy of the task.
